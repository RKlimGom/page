  <h3>What you can find here</h3>
  <p>Welcome to my personal page. Here you will find all stuff that I produce in my carrer as engineer and also
    in my personal life, like texts, videos and anything else. Follow the links and enjoy.
    I have created this site not only to share my professional experience. In the last years I have been producing
    content and I think this can be useful for someone. Also, sometimes I have ideas and would like to share with
    people outside from confusing social network. I really want people to find those ideas and I would like to
    talk about it. This is not made for human resources or headhunters, although they can make use of it if they want.</p><br>
